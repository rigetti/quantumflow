The examples folder contains various illustrations of QuantumFlow in action.


- ``state_prep_w4.py``

	Prepare a 4-qubit W state using sqrt(iswaps) and local gates.

- ``state_prep_w16.py``

	Prepare a 16-qubit W state using sqrt(iswaps) and local gates,
	respecting linear topology

- ``swaptest.py``

	Apply a Swap Test to measure fidelity between two qubits

- ``tensorflow_fit_gate.py``

	Tensorflow example. Given an arbitrary one-qubit gate, use gradient
	descent to find corresponding parameters of a universal ZYZ gate.

- ``eager_fit_gate.py``

	Tensorflow eager mode example. Given an arbitrary one-qubit gate, use
	gradient descent to find corresponding parameters of a universal ZYZ
	gate.
